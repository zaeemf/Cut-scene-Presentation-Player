# Cut-Scene / Presentation Player
An independently created player used to present materials in a simple yet entertaining way. The style of presentation is akin to those from RPGs. The player involves using still images and sets of text, presented by the letter.

Included is a bank of filler images and example texts which can be changed, removed, or added to. Also there exists a script file used to determine length of time any full combination of images and text should remain on screen, along with which image and set of text to use.

Please enjoy!
